# 👋 Hi there! I'm Tiago Moreira

🎓 I'm a **Computer Science student** at **University of Minho**, passionate about embedded systems, software development, and space technology.  
🚀 Currently, I’m part of the **Aurora CubeSat Mission**, where I’m responsible for the software of the Biological Payload subsystem, developing control and communication software for sensors, heaters, and fluidic systems.  
💡 I’m also deeply interested in AI, cybersecurity, and network systems, especially the intersection between reliable software and real-world science.
